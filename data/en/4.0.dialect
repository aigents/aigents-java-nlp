% Each tag definition should reside on a single line.
%
% There are 3 tag definition types:
% "[tagname]:" Dialect names (vectors) which are used as sections.
% "tagname: OPTIONAL_COST" Dialect vector component name, with an optional
%           cost argument. If the cost is missing, it is "very high".
% "tagname" A reference to section "[tagname]", which represents the
%           content of this section.
%
% The "[default]" section, if exists, defines the tags that initially take
% effect.
%
% The first entry must be a section.
% Sections should not be empty.
% Text after % is ignored.
% White space is allowed before, between and after tokens.
% Tags must match the regex: ^[a-z][a-zA-Z\d_-]*$
% Component names which are not defined have a "very high" cost.

% The dialects that currently appear in `4.0.dict` include:
%
% bad-spelling: common spelling mistakes, and thier corrections,
%    for example, writing "there" instead of "their".
%
% colloquial: common regional, poetic or archaic usages, including
%    German-English: "vas is das", poetic/archaic "O'er the hills",
%    1950's modern: "tonite", "thru", Urban: "keep y'mouth shut"
%    slurred speech: "drinkin and carrousin", Irish-American, etc.
%
% headline: support for elided articles, e.g. "thieves rob bank".
%    The problem with headline English is that, although it makes
%    sense in a headline context, it can, and will generate bad
%    parses when applied to non-headline contexts. By making
%    determiners optional, many other rules are thrown off.
