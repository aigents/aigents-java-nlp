Subsequently, sequence analysis identified KRC as a member of the ZAS family of proteins which share the ability to bind ?B-like motifs [15]. DNA competition analysis showed that KRC fusion proteins containing the ZAS-C domain bind specifically to both the RSS and to the ?B motif [14 28]. DNA footprinting analysis further showed that KRC/ZAS-C binds to specific nucleotides within the ?B and the heptamer of the RSS [14]. In this study, using a PCR-based DNA - binding site - selection and amplification procedure, we demonstrated that both the N-terminal ZAS-N and the C-terminal ZAS-C domains are able to bind GT - rich DNA sequences, and confirmed that the RSS and ?B motifs are the high-affinity targets of KRC.

As it happens, genes A and B have Boolean functions that depend on all three genes, A, B, and C. By examination, however, gene C has a Boolean function that depends only on genes A and C, not on gene B. To say that the activity of gene C depends only on A and C and not B means that once the combinations of activities of A and C are defined at a moment T, the next activity of C at T + is indepen-dent of whether B is on or o at time T. Indeed, the Boolean function is C = (not A or not C); that is, gene C will turn on at the next moment if at the current moment either A is not active or C is not active or both are not active.

The folk community is idealized, with no recognition of the huge variety of musical practices (and social forms) involved (think of the differences between the music, and social function, of, say, West African griots, American Indian ceremonial songs and European medieval ballads); in very, very few -- if any -- of these cases is there no class differentiation (and thus hierarchies, divisions of function, and so on); in none would it be true to say that musical production occurs naturally rather than as the result of learned skills and conventions.

The concept of lung fibroblasts as effector cells in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has recently evolved [1 2]. Lung fibroblasts respond, in vitro, to inflammatory cytokines by producing growth factors and collagen, resulting in fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition [2 3 4]. In addition, activated lung fibroblasts have been shown to produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, in vitro, and hence, these cells may also have a role as effector-inflammatory cells [1 2]. This capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target cells, via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms, perpetuating the fibrotic process [2].
Most of our surrogates have been shown to have either agonist or antagonist activity in the appropriate biochemical and / or biological models ([7] manuscripts in preparation).
Previously, PMA was shown to augment IFNg-mediated MHCII expression in MHCII-inducible tumor cell lines [19 20]. Here, we report that the presence of PMA in tissue culture restores IFNg-dependent MHCII expression in the poorly-responding LS1034 colon carcinoma cell line but fails to produce this effect in two other IFNg-resistant cell lines, MSTO-211H mesothelioma and HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma.
We have shown that ?-actinin is abundant in the bone marrow stroma matrix, presumably at focal adhesion sites [5]. We have also reported that a 31 kDa amino-terminal ?-actinin fragment, which we have named mactinin, is generated by the degradation of extracellular ?-actinin by monocyte-secreted urokinase [6]. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that mactinin is present in inflammation caused by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, by examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice with infection [6]. It was not present in mice not challenged with P. carinii, suggesting that inflammaton is necessary for mactinin formation.

However, despite association of the factor V G1691A (factor V Leiden) and prothrombin (factor II) G20210A mutations with venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarction [10 11], neither mutation is strongly associated with risk of stroke [12 13 14 15 16 17 18]. Although a study of British adults found elevated levels of serum homocysteine to be associated with an increased risk of stroke [19], a case-control study of a common polymorphism (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] T677C) that results in increased serum homocysteine concentrations found no difference between patients with stroke and controls in either genotype or allele frequency [20]. Because antiplatelet agents with different mechanisms of action can bring about significant reductions in stroke risk, several platelet receptor genes have been tested as candidate stroke susceptibility genes [21 22]. To date, however, no compelling evidence for an association between any platelet receptor gene polymorphism and risk of stroke has been found.

The one shocker in the book is the revelation of Eisner's heart-and-soul belief that those who criticize Disney simply don't understand it and that `the company's good is unquestionably, inextricably intertwined with the larger social good (Richard Schickel, the Los Angeles Times).

Both stories (and isn't it curious that both papers would independently front such a soft feature ?) note that there is a rich Arab tradition of leaders going out in mufti, with the overall feeling being that this is a quaint feature of a veil- and robe-enmeshed culture.
It is this obsession, which far exceeds anything I have ever encountered in any scholar (and scholars and intellectuals have no little ego and no little ambition), this need to have his fingerprints everywhere, that I find curious but that I also think, ultimately for Gates, is destructive of the very end he probably wants to achieve.
Both Airbus and Boeing have bombarded their planes with cell waves and failed to record any interference; Boeing still recommends that phones not be used in the air -- but to prevent electronic interference similar to (though slightly stronger than) that of a laptop or CD player.
I am afraid that, if what many citizens of the European Community either hope or fear comes true, and English becomes the second language in every country of the Community, there is a good chance that many of these hybrids (shopper for supermarket trolley, processimulator for simulator, and compacdiscontainer) will eventually find their way into the English as she is spoke.
This means that there is a 95 percent chance (there's the degree of confidence) that between 30 and 40 percent of the population supports McCain (that's McCain's 35 percent plus or minus the margin of error), and a 95 percent chance that between 27 and 37 percent supports Bush.
This may give a better chance of success to the much - mocked millennium celebrations in Paris and London, the former involving the Eiffel Tower laying an egg and huge plastic fishes poking their heads out of the Seine, and the latter -- as caustically emphasized in all of today's British newspapers -- involving no known purpose at all apart from the building of a giant dome at Greenwich at a cost of more than $ 1 billion.

The program thought it could do this by a) making us watch Pepsi - sponsored movies featuring anti - drug propaganda and shrewd product placement; b) reinforcing the most obnoxious cliques on campus by choosing all the `All Star officers from a popular group of athletes and cheerleaders (on average, B and C students who drank, smoked, and skipped class); c) doing everything possible to conceal the fact that high school's purpose is education; and d) giving us the opportunity to buy as much `All Star merchandise as our parents could afford.

As long as psychiatry is in the business of forced institutionalization (and it still is, though less so than in the'60s), it seems clear that the diagnoses that license dragging people off the street can hardly be subject to enough old - fashioned suspicious scrutiny.
As those who use infer for imply might be somehow stigmatized in (some) educated circles, failure to report such a usage leaves the suspicious user of a dictionary (or grammar) who has the wit to look it up facing a serious lacuna in the information given about the language.

Its mockumentary premise : Three young filmmakers disappear while trekking through the woods of Maryland in search of a local witch; a year later, their footage is found and presented as The Blair Witch Project.

A multicenter, randomized, double - blind, placebo - controlled trial to assess treatment effect of pimobendan on exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure [3]. 'The primary pre - specified analysis of exercise time was limited to those patients who had at least the first follow up (four - week) exercise test carried out and had shown good compliance up to the day of the test.
During exercise, slow twitch motor units serving oxidative fibers are recruited first during moderate exercise, and motor units serving glycolytic fibers are recruited later and during more severe exercise [1]. This is in contrast to electrical stimulation of sufficient intensity where all motor units are thought to be activated simultaneously [31]. The larger regional difference in VEGF mRNA signal after electrical stimulation may be due to the fact that this protocol was more metabolically demanding than the treadmill exercise protocol, or indeed because the rat muscle was hypoxic during electrical stimulation.
However, there may be cause for some optimism for the average mortal, since endurance exercise training in healthy humans leads to fiber - type specific increases in the abundance of PGC-1 and PPAR-? protein in skeletal muscle (Russell et al.
Cardiovascular diseases, a major health concern in industrialized countries [1 2 3 4], include vasculopathies such as atherosclerosis [5] and autoimmune vascular diseases such as lupus [6], graft versus host disease [7], and systemic sclerosis [8]. Many factors are involved in the development and progression of these diseases including lifestyle (diet, smoking, and lack of physical exercise); genes, and environment [1 2 3 4]. Also, infectious agents, including both bacterial (Chlamydia) [9 10], and viral (CMV) [11 12], have been implicated.
