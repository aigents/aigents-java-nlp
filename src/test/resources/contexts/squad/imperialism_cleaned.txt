Imperialism is defined as "A policy of extending the power and influence of a country through diplomacy or military force." Imperialism is particularly focused on the control that one group, often a state power, has on another group of people. There is "formal" and "informal" imperialism. "Formal imperialism" is defined as "physical control or colonial rule". "Informal imperialism" is less direct; however, it is still a powerful form of dominance.
