The garret was a shadowy , suggestive , delightful place , as all garrets should be.

And , over all , was a great mountain range of snowy clouds in the blue southern sky.

Diana Wright , three years older than when we last saw her , had grown somewhat matronly in the intervening time.

Avonlea folks knew why Diana had called her Anne , of course , but Avonlea folks were puzzled by the Cordelia.

There had never been a Cordelia in the Wright or Barry connections.

But Diana and Anne smiled at each other.

They knew how Small Anne Cordelia had come by her name.

" You always hated geometry , " said Diana with a retrospective smile.

" I should think you'd be real glad to be through with teaching , anyhow. "

" Oh , I've always liked teaching , apart from geometry.

These past three years in Summerside have been very pleasant ones.

Mrs. Harmon Andrews told me when I came home that I wouldn't likely find married life as much better than teaching as I expected.

Anne's laugh , as blithe and irresistible as of yore , with an added note of sweetness and maturity , rang through the garret.

" You needn't let what Mrs. Harmon says worry you , " said Diana , with the calm assurance of the four-years matron.

" Married life has its ups and downs , of course.

You mustn't expect that everything will always go smoothly.

But I can assure you , Anne , that it's a happy life , when you're married to the right man. "

Anne smothered a smile.

Diana's airs of vast experience always amused her a little.

" I daresay I'll be putting them on too , when I've been married four years , " she thought.

" Surely my sense of humor will preserve me from it , though. "

" Yes.

That was what I wanted to tell you when I ' phoned to you to come down today.

By the way , I can't realize that we really have telephones in Avonlea now.

It sounds so preposterously up-to-date and modernish for this darling , leisurely old place. "

" We can thank the A. V. I. S. for them , " said Diana.

" We should never have got the line if they hadn't taken the matter up and carried it through.

There was enough cold water thrown to discourage any society.

But they stuck to it , nevertheless.

You did a splendid thing for Avonlea when you founded that society , Anne.

What fun we did have at our meetings !

Will you ever forget the blue hall and Judson Parker's scheme for painting medicine advertisements on his fence ? "

" I don't know that I'm wholly grateful to the A. V. I. S. in the matter of the telephone , " said Anne.

" Oh , I know it's most convenient even more so than our old device of signalling to each other by flashes of candlelight !

And , as Mrs. Rachel says , ' Avonlea must keep up with the procession , that's what. '

I should like to have it kept always just as it was in the dear old years.

That's foolish and sentimental and impossible.

So I shall immediately become wise and practical and possible.

" That's the worst of it , " sighed Diana.

" It's so annoying to hear the receivers going down whenever you ring anyone up.

Today , when you called me , I distinctly heard that queer clock of the Pyes ' striking.

So no doubt Josie or Gertie was listening. "

" Oh , so that is why you said , ' You've got a new clock at Green Gables , haven't you ? '

I couldn't imagine what you meant.

I heard a vicious click as soon as you had spoken.

I suppose it was the Pye receiver being hung up with profane energy.

Well , never mind the Pyes.

As Mrs. Rachel says , ' Pyes they always were and Pyes they always will be , world without end , amen. '

I want to talk of pleasanter things.

It's all settled as to where my new home shall be. "

" Oh , Anne , where ?

I do hope it's near here. "

" No-o-o , that's the drawback.

Gilbert is going to settle at Four Winds Harbor sixty miles from here. "

" Sixty !

It might as well be six hundred , " sighed Diana.

" I never can get further from home now than Charlottetown. "

" You'll have to come to Four Winds.

It's the most beautiful harbor on the Island.

There's a little village called Glen St. Mary at its head , and Dr. David Blythe has been practicing there for fifty years.

He is Gilbert's great-uncle , you know.

He is going to retire , and Gilbert is to take over his practice.

Dr. Blythe is going to keep his house , though , so we shall have to find a habitation for ourselves.

" Where are you going for your wedding tour ? " asked Diana.

" Nowhere.

Don't look horrified , Diana dearest.

You suggest Mrs. Harmon Andrews.

I want to spend MY honeymoon at Four Winds in my own dear house of dreams. "

" And you've decided not to have any bridesmaid ? "

" There isn't any one to have.

You and Phil and Priscilla and Jane all stole a march on me in the matter of marriage ; and Stella is teaching in Vancouver.

I have no other ' kindred soul ' and I won't have a bridesmaid who isn't. "

" But you are going to wear a veil , aren't you ? " asked Diana , anxiously.

" Yes , indeedy.

I shouldn't feel like a bride without one.

You should have seen the foreign missionary Priscilla married.

But of course there are no cannibals in Japan. "

" Your wedding dress is a dream , anyhow , " sighed Diana rapturously.

" You'll look like a perfect queen in it you're so tall and slender.

How DO you keep so slim , Anne ?

I'm fatter than ever I'll soon have no waist at all. "

" Stoutness and slimness seem to be matters of predestination , " said Anne.

It sounds quite romantic to be ' slender , ' but ' skinny ' has a very different tang. "

" Mrs. Harmon has been talking about your trousseau.

Anne laughed.

" My dresses ARE nice.

I love pretty things.

I remember the first pretty dress I ever had the brown gloria Matthew gave me for our school concert.

Before that everything I had was so ugly.

It seemed to me that I stepped into a new world that night. "

And you were so furious because he put your pink tissue rose in his breast pocket !

You didn't much imagine then that you would ever marry him. "

" Oh , well , that's another instance of predestination , " laughed Anne , as they went down the garret stairs.

CHAPTER @number@

THE HOUSE OF DREAMS

There was more excitement in the air of Green Gables than there had ever been before in all its history.

Even Marilla was so excited that she couldn't help showing it which was little short of being phenomenal.

" There's never been a wedding in this house , " she said , half apologetically , to Mrs. Rachel Lynde.

We've had deaths here my father and mother died here as well as Matthew ; and we've even had a birth here.

But there's never been a wedding before.

It does seem so strange to think of Anne being married.

In a way she just seems to me the little girl Matthew brought home here fourteen years ago.

I can't realize that she's grown up.

I shall never forget what I felt when I saw Matthew bringing in a GIRL.

I wonder what became of the boy we would have got if there hadn't been a mistake.

I wonder what HIS fate was. "

Many things have changed since then , that's what. "

Mrs. Rachel sighed , and then brisked up again.

When weddings were in order Mrs. Rachel was ready to let the dead past bury its dead.

" I'm going to give Anne two of my cotton warp spreads , " she resumed.

" A tobacco-stripe one and an apple-leaf one.

She tells me they're getting to be real fashionable again.

Well , fashion or no fashion , I don't believe there's anything prettier for a spare-room bed than a nice apple-leaf spread , that's what.

I must see about getting them bleached.

I've had them sewed up in cotton bags ever since Thomas died , and no doubt they're an awful color.

But there's a month yet , and dew-bleaching will work wonders. "

Only a month !

Marilla sighed and then said proudly :

" I'm giving Anne that half dozen braided rugs I have in the garret.

I never supposed she'd want them they're so old-fashioned , and nobody seems to want anything but hooked mats now.

But she asked me for them said she'd rather have them than anything else for her floors.

They ARE pretty.

I made them of the nicest rags , and braided them in stripes.

It was such company these last few winters.

And I'll make her enough blue plum preserve to stock her jam closet for a year.

It seems real strange.

Those blue plum trees hadn't even a blossom for three years , and I thought they might as well be cut down.

And this last spring they were white , and such a crop of plums I never remember at Green Gables. "

" Well , thank goodness that Anne and Gilbert really are going to be married after all.

" It was a great relief to find out that she really didn't mean to take the Kingsport man.

" He's Gilbert Blythe , " said Marilla contentedly.

Marilla felt that , in some strange way , his marriage with Anne would put right that old mistake.

Good had come out of the evil of the ancient bitterness.

As for Anne herself , she was so happy that she almost felt frightened.

The gods , so says the old superstition , do not like to behold too happy mortals.

It is certain , at least , that some human beings do not.

Human nature is not obliged to be consistent.

Mrs. Inglis nee Jane Andrews , to quote from the Daily Enterprise came with her mother and Mrs. Jasper Bell.

But in Jane the milk of human kindness had not been curdled by years of matrimonial bickerings.

Her lines had fallen in pleasant places.

In spite of the fact as Mrs. Rachel Lynde would say that she had married a millionaire , her marriage had been happy.

Wealth had not spoiled her.

" Well , the Blythes generally keep their word when they've once passed it , no matter what happens.

Let me see you're twenty-five , aren't you , Anne ?

When I was a girl twenty-five was the first corner.

But you look quite young.

Red-headed people always do. "

" Red hair is very fashionable now , " said Anne , trying to smile , but speaking rather coldly.

" So it is so it is , " conceded Mrs. Harmon.

" There's no telling what queer freaks fashion will take.

Well , Anne , your things are very pretty , and very suitable to your position in life , aren't they , Jane ?

I hope you'll be very happy.

You have my best wishes , I'm sure.

A long engagement doesn't often turn out well.

But , of course , in your case it couldn't be helped. "

" Gilbert looks very young for a doctor.

I'm afraid people won't have much confidence in him , " said Mrs. Jasper Bell gloomily.

Then she shut her mouth tightly , as if she had said what she considered it her duty to say and held her conscience clear.

She belonged to the type which always has a stringy black feather in its hat and straggling locks of hair on its neck.

In their shadows Anne and Gilbert talked in lover-fashion of their new home and their new life together.

" I've found a nest for us , Anne. "

" Oh , where ?

Not right in the village , I hope.

I wouldn't like that altogether. "

" No.

There was no house to be had in the village.

This is a little white house on the harbor shore , half way between Glen St. Mary and Four Winds Point.

It's a little out of the way , but when we get a ' phone in that won't matter so much.

The situation is beautiful.

It looks to the sunset and has the great blue harbor before it.

The sand-dunes aren't very far away the sea winds blow over them and the sea spray drenches them. "

" But the house itself , Gilbert , OUR first home ?

What is it like ? "

" Not very large , but large enough for us.

It is about sixty years old the oldest house in Four Winds.

But it has been kept in pretty good repair , and was all done over about fifteen years ago shingled , plastered and re-floored.

It was well built to begin with.

I understand that there was some romantic story connected with its building , but the man I rented it from didn't know it. "

" He said Captain Jim was the only one who could spin that old yarn now. "

" Who is Captain Jim ? "

" The keeper of the lighthouse on Four Winds Point.

You'll love that Four Winds light , Anne.

It's a revolving one , and it flashes like a magnificent star through the twilights.

We can see it from our living room windows and our front door. "

" Who owns the house ? "

" Well , it's the property of the Glen St. Mary Presbyterian Church now , and I rented it from the trustees.

But it belonged until lately to a very old lady , Miss Elizabeth Russell.

She died last spring , and as she had no near relatives she left her property to the Glen St. Mary Church.

Glen St. Mary folks prefer plush brocade and sideboards with mirrors and ornamentations , I fancy.

But Miss Russell's furniture is very good and I feel sure you'll like it , Anne. "

" So far , good , " said Anne , nodding cautious approval.

" But , Gilbert , people cannot live by furniture alone.

You haven't yet mentioned one very important thing.

Are there TREES about this house ? "

" Heaps of them , oh , dryad !

Our front door opens right into the garden , but there is another entrance a little gate hung between two firs.

The hinges are on one trunk and the catch on the other.

Their boughs form an arch overhead. "

" Oh , I'm so glad !

I couldn't live where there were no trees something vital in me would starve.

Well , after that , there's no use asking you if there's a brook anywhere near.

THAT would be expecting too much. "

" But there IS a brook and it actually cuts across one corner of the garden. "
